## ADL 
Removed. To be replaced with the AMDGPU sysfs interface, or some sort of abstraction layer perhaps.

## API
Moved into its own subdirectory. Rudimentary bash client script included, uses netcat and jq.

## CMAKE
Working on it. 

## AUTOTOOLS


## GNULIB
Largely left alone so far, headers have been tidied into the include/ directory. This build mainly
targets the GNU/Linux platform anyway, so whether and how far we need GNUlib modules is worth thinking
about. So what is it providing and what does that do?

### sigprocmask noinst_LIBRARIES	= libsph.a

libsph_a_SOURCES	= bmw.c echo.c jh.c luffa.c gost.c simd.c blake.c cubehash.c groestl.c keccak.c shavite.c skein.c sha2.c sha2big.c fugue.c hamsi.c panama.c shabal.c whirlpool.c sha256_Y.c ripemd.c





## OpenCL
Using Khronos OpenCL headers, sticking at version 1.2 to suit amdgpu
All versions are under include and can be changed at config time.

## UTHASH
Now imported as a submodule, compiled as libut.a and function definitions from libut.h
