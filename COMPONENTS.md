## ADL 
Removed. To be replaced with the AMDGPU sysfs interface, or some sort of abstraction layer perhaps.

## API
Moved into its own subdirectory. Rudimentary bash client included.


## GNULIB
Largely left alone so far, headers tidied up under include.


## UTHASH
Now imported as a submodule, compiled as libut.a and function definitions from libut.h
