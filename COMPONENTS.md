## ADL 
Removed. To be replaced with the AMDGPU sysfs interface, or some sort of abstraction layer perhaps.

## API
Moved into its own subdirectory. Rudimentary bash client included.

## CMAKE
Working on it. 

## GNU AUTOTOOLS


## GNULIB
Largely left alone so far, headers tidied up under include.


## OpenCL
Using Khronos OpenCL headers, sticking at version 1.2 to suit amdgpu
All versions are under include and can be changed at config time.

## UTHASH
Now imported as a submodule, compiled as libut.a and function definitions from libut.h
